## //> SYSTEM INFILTRATION IN PROGRESS...

**[CLASSIFIED]** 
**ACCESS LEVEL: OPERATIVE EYES ONLY**

Welcome to NEOTERMINAL - a cyberpunk hacker simulation designed to transform CLI neophytes into terminal masters through immersive missions in a dystopian cyberspace.

## //> MISSION BRIEFING

_The year is 2057. Megacorporations rule from gleaming arcologies while the digital underground fights for freedom in the shadows of the net. You've been recruited by the hacktivist collective GHOST//SIGNAL to help take down the PANOPTICON system - but first, you need to master the tools of the trade._

NEOTERMINAL is more than a learning tool - it's a gateway into a world where command line mastery feels like what it truly is: **digital sorcery**. Forget boring tutorials and documentation. NEOTERMINAL uses adaptive AI to analyze your command patterns and construct personalized missions that gradually expand your skillset while keeping you immersed in the cyberpunk narrative.

## //> SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- **OS**: Linux/macOS/Windows with WSL
- **Node.js**: v16.0.0+
- **RAM**: 4GB+
- **Storage**: 500MB
- **Hardware**: Any terminal capable of displaying 256 colors
- **Wetware**: Human consciousness with desire to transcend mundane computing

## //> QUICK INSTALLATION

```bash
# Clone the digital construct
git clone https://github.com/ghost-signal/neoterminal.git

# Enter the matrix
cd neoterminal

# Initialize systems
npm install

# Activate neural interface
npm start
```

## //> CORE FEATURES

- **Adaptive Skill Analysis**: AI engine tracks command usage and tailors missions to your skill level
- **Cyberpunk Narrative**: Progress through a compelling story as you master the CLI
- **Real-time Feedback**: Receive guidance without breaking immersion
- **Progress Tracking**: Visualize your command mastery through neural network maps
- **Sandbox Environment**: Practice in a secure simulation without risk to your actual system

## //> SKILL PROGRESSION PATH

NEOTERMINAL categorizes operatives into five clearance levels:

1. **INITIATE**: Navigation, basic file operations, help systems
2. **OPERATOR**: Advanced file manipulation, text processing, system monitoring
3. **NETRUNNER**: Text manipulation, networking, process control
4. **GHOST**: Shell scripting, complex pipelines, advanced networking
5. **ARCHITECT**: System administration, security operations, performance tuning

Your clearance level increases automatically as the system detects improved command fluency.

## //> CONTRIBUTION PROTOCOL

NEOTERMINAL is open-source and welcomes contributions from fellow operatives. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed instructions on how to submit mission ideas, improve the narrative engine, or enhance terminal emulation.

## //> SECURITY NOTICE

NEOTERMINAL operates in a sandboxed environment and does not modify your actual system beyond its installation directory. All commands are intercepted and simulated within the game environment.
